I received my B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University and completed my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at Seoul National University (SNU IPAI)

I am currently focused on research at the intersection of generative modeling, trajectory optimization, and reinforcement learning, with a broader interest in building intelligent systems capable of learning and planning in complex environments. 

My recent work explores the theoretical and practical aspects of flow- and diffusion-based models, including simulation-based optimization and sample-adaptive inference strategies. 

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities and research internships starting in 2026, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in collaborating with groups working on fundamental advances in machine learning, world modeling, and control.
